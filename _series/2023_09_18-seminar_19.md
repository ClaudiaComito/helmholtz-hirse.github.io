On September 18, 2023, 2pm, **Anna-Lena Lamprecht** from the [Institute of Computer Science, University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cs-se/team/prof-dr-anna-lena-lamprecht) will restart the HiRSE Seminar after the summer break with her talk on **Research Software, Software Research, and more**.

**Abstract**:
In today's research landscape, research software and Research Software Engineering (RSE) play pivotal roles, and receive increasing recognition within the scientific community. Additionally, there is a growing interest in researching RSE practices themselves, aiming to better understand software development processes in science and enhance them.

In this talk I take a closer look at the interconnection of research software, research software engineering, software research, software engineering research, RSE research, an more. I provide an overview of RSE research topics and initiatives, offering insights into this evolving field and presenting opportunities for involvement.
