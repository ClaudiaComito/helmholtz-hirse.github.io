**Abstract**: Continuous Integration, Testing, Deployment and Benchmarking (Cx) are increasingly important in Research Software Engineering.
For HPC applications most typical and widely available services, e.g. github-actions or GitlabCI, are not well suited and specifically lag the possibility to test integration with e.g. MPI or run larger scale tests and benchmarks.
To overcome this limitation and enable a sustainable research software development, we at KIT are offering a Cx service to the users of our HPC clusters for over a year.
In this seminar, we will present the setup at KIT, talk about possibilities, challenges and limitations of the setup, and will highlight some of the usage and adaption experiences of users of the services.

The talk will be held via Zoom. The link will be posted in the [HiRSE Mattermost](https://mattermost.hzdr.de/hirse), in the FZJ [#rse Rocket.Chat channel](https://chat.fz-juelich.de/channel/rse) and the RSE mailing lists of the HiRSE partners. If you would like to attend, but think you may not get the link through these channels, please write to [hirse@fz-juelich.de](mailto:hirse@fz-juelich.de).
