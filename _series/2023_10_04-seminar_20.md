On October 4, 2023, 11am, [**Tobias Schlauch**](https://www.dlr.de/sc/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1192/1635_read-25578/sortby-lastname/) from [DLR Institute for Software Technology](https://www.dlr.de/sc) will continue the HiRSE Seminar with his talk on **All you need to know about Software Licenses as an RSE**. 
<!--more-->

**Abstract**:
A basic understanding of software licenses and related topics is necessary for RSEs to successfully publish their research software from the legal point of view. Typical questions are: What license should I use for code, documentation, or data? Can I combine this specific set of software licenses? How to document this information?

This talk gives an overview about the copyright and software license basics. Using an example of a data analysis script written in Python, we go through the process of clarifying all relevant aspects and documenting them in a practical way. In this context, we introduce REUSE SOFTWARE which provides a standardized approach to document copyright and license information as well as helpful tools.
