On May 30, 2023, 3pm, **Pablo Orviz** from [IFCA](https://ifca.unican.es/es-es/member/orviz) and **Samuel Bernardo** from [LIP, Lisboa](https://www.lip.pt/?section=about&page=person-details&details&id=839) will continue the HiRSE Seminar with their talk on **Leveraging the SQAaaS platform to adopt and get recognition for quality practices in software development**.

**Abstract**:
The Software Quality Assurance as a Service (SQAaaS) platform [1] features on the one hand the Pipeline as a Service module, which allows the graphical composition of continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Once the software is available in the source code repository, a pipeline will be triggered automatically to verify and validate each subsequent change in the code. The pipelines are composed using the JePL library [2], which simplifies the task of maintenance since pipelines are described using YAML files. On the other hand, the SQAaaS platform provides a tool that evaluates the quality achievements of different digital assets, i.e. source code, services and data: the Quality Assessment and Awarding module. The outcome of such assessment include quality reports as well as verifiable and shareable digital badges that embed metadata about the different attributes of the digital assets being evaluated.
