On June 24, 2022, 11am, [**Terry Cojean**](https://github.com/tcojean) from [KIT/SCC](https://www.scc.kit.edu/) will continue the HiRSE Seminar with his talk on **Cx on NHR@KIT HPC machines for the Ginkgo software**. 
<!--more-->

**Abstract**: With a strong reliance on research software projects in both industry and for scientific simulations, research software sustainability is increasingly becoming a major point of contention. A necessary but nonsufficient aspect of software sustainability is Continuous Integration and Benchmarking (CI/CB/Cx). In this talk, we will showcase the Cx practices of the Ginkgo numerical linear algebra framework, which was designed with unit testing, good software design techniques as well as Cx practices as centerpieces. Because of HPC software constraints, access to HPC clusters for both CI and CB is essential to ensure correctness. We will show our configurable solution for running Cx on HPC clusters implemented thanks to a custom gitlab runner, and relying on the enroot container technology and SLURM.

The talk will be held online. The link will be posted in the [HiRSE Mattermost](https://mattermost.hzdr.de/hirse), in the FZJ [#rse Rocket.Chat channel](https://chat.fz-juelich.de/channel/rse) and the RSE mailing lists of the HiRSE partners. If you would like to attend, but think you may not get the link through these channels, please write to [hirse@fz-juelich.de](mailto:hirse@fz-juelich.de).
