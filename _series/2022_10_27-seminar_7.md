On October 27, 2022, 2pm, [**Jessica Mitchell**](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/mitchell_j) from [FZJ/INM-6](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-6) will contribute to the FZJ Open Science Week with her HiRSE Seminar talk on **Docs-as-code: how to write documentation with developers**. 
<!--more-->

**Abstract**: 
Documentation is often an overlooked part of software development. Here I discuss the concept of docs-as-code as way to streamline documentation development alongside the code. From writing, reviewing, and testing documentation, I will show how the same workflows used in code development can be applied to documentation.  We will look into this concept and show how this can work in practical setting using NEST simulator as an example. 

The talk will be held online. The link will be posted in the [HiRSE Mattermost](https://mattermost.hzdr.de/hirse), in the FZJ [#rse Rocket.Chat channel](https://chat.fz-juelich.de/channel/rse), RSE mailing lists of the HiRSE partners (if any) and via the [de-RSE mailing list](https://de-rse.org/de/join.html) and [Mattermost chat](https://chat.gwdg.de/channel/derse).
