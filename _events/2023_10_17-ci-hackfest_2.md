HiRSE_PS is organizing a coding session on Continuous Benchmarking on October 17-18, 2023, lunch-to-lunch, at Jülich Supercomputing Centre.
<!--more-->

The goal of this meeting is to bring together various groups and codes to sit together and get some continuous benchmarking set up/improved/corrected/enhanced during the event. There will be no lengthy tutorial nor talks nor anything organized in the way, but plenty of people to help, to learn from and to talk to. The event will go from lunch to lunch, i.e. we’ll meet on Day 1 (Tuesday, October 17) for lunch at JSC's rotunda and leave on Day 2 (Wednesday, October 18) after lunch. Bus shuttles will bring external participants to the hotel on Tuesday evening and back to the venue on Wednesday morning.

 This is an invitation-only event. If you are interested and have not been contacted concerning this, please do not hesitate to write to [hirse@fz-juelich.de](mailto:hirse@fz-juelich.de).
