On December 7, 2022, 10am, [**Claudia Comito**](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/comito_c) from the [Heat](https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat) team at [JSC](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc) will continue the HiRSE Seminar with her talk on **Heat goes GSoC. On building new features and broadening our community with Google Summer of Code**.

**Abstract**: 
Developed at FZJ, KIT and DLR, the [Helmholtz Analytics Toolkit](https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat) (Heat) is an open-source Python library for high-performance data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning. It provides highly optimized algorithms and data structures for tensor computations using CPUs, GPUs and distributed cluster systems. Heat's Numpy-like API makes writing scalable, GPU-accelerated applications straightforward - at the same time, parallelism implemented under the hood via MPI provides a significant improvement in efficiency and performance with respect to, e.g., Dask.

Heat has a large pool of eager wanna-be users in need of support and new features, and a tiny pool of core developers barely keeping up. This year we've broadened  our contributors base significantly through the Google Summer of Code program. In this talk, after briefly introducing the library, I'll tell you about our GSoC experience, from application through successful completion of the program under the FZJ umbrella, and how we are preparing for the next round.
