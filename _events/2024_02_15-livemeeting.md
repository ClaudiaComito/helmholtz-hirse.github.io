On Feburary 15-16, 2024, we will have our thirds HiRSE_PS live meeting, at the [GenoHotel Karlsruhe](https://www.genohotel-karlsruhe.de/en), live, in person! Registration is open now: <https://events.hifis.net/event/1159/>
<!--more-->

With the HiRSE_PS project already halfway through, it is now time to meet in person again and talk in detail about what happened, what will happen, what is good and what is bad.

The agenda is currently under preparation and will be announced as soon as possible. So far, the plan is to have short presentations on what has been done in individual codes and work packages within HiRSE_PS (what has been made possible, started, intensified, implemented, ....? How is the benefit of the funding by HiRSE_PS measurable?) and what is still to be accomplished within HiRSE_PS until the end of 2024 for the project. And also have time for discussion, exchange and working on the codes.
