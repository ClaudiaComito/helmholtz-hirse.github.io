**Abstract**: 
At a ‘Collaborations Workshop’ organised by the Software Sustainability Institute in the UK, the realisation emerged that the lack of a recognised job title for developers in research was having a knock on effect making many activities difficult. With many job titles being used, it would be impossible for the Institute to support and campaign for the role. Those in the role spoke of how it was difficult to recruit and difficult for developers to find a job.  And so, on the 21st of March 2012, the term Research Software Engineer was first coined: the Research Software Engineer (RSE). This gave a focus for the next ten years of support and has enabled developers to find their tribe online and in-person. In 2022, we are celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the term and of the Research Software Engineering movement that started in the UK and is now around the world. This talk will look back at the last 10 years, the achievements so far in the UK and worldwide and some of the activities coming up in 2023. 


The talk will be held online. The link will be posted in the [HiRSE Mattermost](https://mattermost.hzdr.de/hirse), in the FZJ [#rse Rocket.Chat channel](https://chat.fz-juelich.de/channel/rse) and the RSE mailing lists of the HiRSE partners (if any). If you would like to attend, but think you may not get the link through these channels, please write to [hirse@fz-juelich.de](mailto:hirse@fz-juelich.de).
