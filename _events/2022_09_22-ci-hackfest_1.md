HiRSE_PS is organizing a coding session on continuous integration. This meeting will be held in-person at GenoHotel in Karlsruhe.
<!--more-->

The goal of this meeting is to bring together various groups and codes to sit together and get some CI set up/improved/corrected/enhanced during the event. There will be no lengthy tutorial nor talks nor anything organized in the way, but plenty of people to help, to learn from and to talk to. The event will go "from lunch to lunch", i.e. we'll meet on Day 1 (Thursday, September 22) for lunch and leave on Day 2 (Friday, September 23) after lunch. This will be an in-person event organized by KIT/SCC at the [GenoHotel](https://goo.gl/maps/iWnxuUWEPinQoHh28) in Karlsruhe. 

 This is an invitation-only event for HiRSE_PS members. If you are an interested member of HiRSE_PS and have not been contacted concerning this, please do not hesitate to write to [hirse@fz-juelich.de](mailto:hirse@fz-juelich.de).
