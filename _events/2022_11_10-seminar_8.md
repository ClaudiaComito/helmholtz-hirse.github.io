<!--more-->

**Abstract**: 
How can I contribute to improve the quality of research? That is the question I have been asking myself and in this talk I will share the answer that I came up with. I will give some food for thought on the role of research software engineering and Open Science on research quality and I will share why sometimes improving research can mean ignoring academic incentives. 

The talk will be held online. The link will be posted in the HiRSE_PS-internal [HiRSE Mattermost](https://mattermost.hzdr.de/hirse), in the FZJ [#rse Rocket.Chat channel](https://chat.fz-juelich.de/channel/rse), RSE mailing lists of the HiRSE partners (if any) and via the [de-RSE mailing list](https://de-rse.org/de/join.html) and [Mattermost](https://chat.gwdg.de/channel/derse).
