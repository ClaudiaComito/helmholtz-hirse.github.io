On April 19-20, 2023, we will have our second HiRSE_PS live meeting, at the [GenoHotel Karlsruhe](https://www.genohotel-karlsruhe.de/en), live, in person! Registration is open now: <https://events.hifis.net/event/679/>
<!--more-->

With the HiRSE_PS project already halfway through, it is now time to meet in person again and talk in detail about what happened, what will happen, what is good and what is bad.

The agenda is currently under preparation and will be announced as soon as possible. So far, the plan is to have short presentations on what has been done in individual codes and work packages within HiRSE_PS (what has been made possible, started, intensified, implemented, ....? How is the benefit of the funding by HiRSE_PS measurable?) and what is still to be accomplished within HiRSE_PS until the end of 2023 for the project. We are also asking for your input on the agenda: What would you like to have discussed or done at the meeting (hackathon, discuss specific topics, etc.) â€“ please add provide your suggestions when registering. 

Also, as in Obbendorf, we kindly ask you to feel free to bring along your posters (e.g. on recent developments or achievements) if you already have them at hand.
