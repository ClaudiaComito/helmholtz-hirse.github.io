**Abstract**: In these days of data deluge and software code everywhere, there’s lots to take in as a scientist. There are people eager to go serious on research data management. Some are doing research software engineering for ages, also not calling it by that name. And others are looking at data with tools originating from the 90s and storing it only on their lab PC. If you find it hard to see a path through all these new ideas, tech and funders requirements, this talk might give you some insights. Spoiler: this is about the ultimate goal of reproducible research, connecting these activity bubbles. RSE and RDM, a “match made in heaven”.

The talk will be held online. The link will be posted in the [HiRSE Mattermost](https://mattermost.hzdr.de/hirse), in the FZJ [#rse Rocket.Chat channel](https://chat.fz-juelich.de/channel/rse) and the RSE mailing lists of the HiRSE partners. If you would like to attend, but think you may not get the link through these channels, please write to [hirse@fz-juelich.de](mailto:hirse@fz-juelich.de).
