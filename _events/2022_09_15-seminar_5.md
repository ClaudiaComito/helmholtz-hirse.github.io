On September 15, 2022, 2pm, [**Bernadette Fritzsch**](https://www.awi.de/ueber-uns/organisation/mitarbeiter/detailseite/bernadette-fritzsch.html) from [AWI](https://www.awi.de/) will restart the HiRSE Seminar after the summer break with her talk on **Research Software and the people behind it**. 
<!--more-->

**Abstract**: Research software has been part of scientific work for many years. But their development has been hidden for a long time and has often not been adequately appreciated. Research software has only recently become the focus of broader interest and its importance for the quality of research is succinctly formulated by the slogan "Better software - better research". For all those who develop software in the research environment and for research use, the term research software engineer RSE has become common for some time. The community of RSEs has developed as a grassroots movement, which also has a national chapter in Germany with the de-RSE e.V. The association and its activities will be presented in the talk.

The talk will be held online. The link will be posted in the [HiRSE Mattermost](https://mattermost.hzdr.de/hirse), in the FZJ [#rse Rocket.Chat channel](https://chat.fz-juelich.de/channel/rse) and the RSE mailing lists of the HiRSE partners (if any). If you would like to attend, but think you may not get the link through these channels, please write to [hirse@fz-juelich.de](mailto:hirse@fz-juelich.de).
