# 4C: A multi-physics solver

The primary project objective of this project is to develop and implement a concept that allows many research groups to use robust and accurate multi-physics software, which is based on the code BACI developed over the last years at the Institute of Computational Mechanics, TUM. We believe that this step will significantly benefit the research in our community and make it more efficient. In the longer run, a software licensing model will encourage other groups to actively participate in the design and development of the software, allowing distributing the development to more shoulders and making the whole ecosystem more sustainable as the importance of the original site will be reduced.


## Goals

* Establish 4C is an open-source simulation environment for multi-physics problems
  - 4C aims at full spectrum from pure research questions to real-world applications
  - 4C aims at realistic applications
  - 4C aims at realizing computationally efficient solvers (from a methodological and algorithmic perspective, and from an HPC perspective)
* Use modern C++ standard and software design patterns
* A lean project utilizing state-of-the-art libraries (deal.II, Trilinos, ExaDG)
