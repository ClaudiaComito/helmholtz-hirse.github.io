      <p>
        The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is a hub of transdisciplinary
        research and digital scholarship where University of Illinois faculty, staff, and students,
        and collaborators from around the globe, unite to address research grand challenges for the
        benefit of science and society.
        Current research focus areas are Bioinformatics and Health Sciences, Computing and Data
        Sciences, Culture and Society, Earth and Environment, Materials and Manufacturing, and Physics
        and Astronomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Center also provides integrated cyberinfrastructureâ€”computing, data, networking, and
        visualization resources and expertise that are essential to the work of scientists,
        engineers, and scholars at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and across the
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        NCSA is also an engine of economic impact for the state and the nation, helping companies
        address computing and data challenges and providing hands-on training for undergraduate and
        graduate students and post-docs.
